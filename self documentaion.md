Update the Name tag on your Jenkins EC2 Instance to Jenkins-Ansible

(SCREENSHOT)

Install and Configure Ansible on EC2 Instance
Step 1: Connect to your EC2 Instance
Go to your AWS console, select EC2, and locate your instance for Jenkins-Ansible.
Copy the Public IP of your instance and use it to SSH into your instance:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i path_to_your_key.pem ubuntu@your_instance_public_ip

(Screenshot)

Once connected, update your instance:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update

(screenshot)

Install Ansible
Install Ansible directly on the instance:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install ansible -y

(screenshot)

Check your Ansible version by running ansible --version

(screenshot)

go to your GitHub account create a new repository and name it ansible-config-mgt.

Configure Jenkins for Archiving Repository Content
Step 1: Create a New Freestyle Project in Jenkins
Open Jenkins (http://your_instance_public_ip:8080).

(screenshot)

Select New Item on the Jenkins dashboard.
Name your project ansible, select Freestyle project, and click OK.

(screenshot)

In the Source Code Management section, select Git.
In the Repository URL field, paste the URL of your ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository and your github crendentials

(screenshot)

allocate an Elastic IP to your Jenkins-Ansible server to avoid reconfiguring GitHub webhook to a new IP address

(sceenshot)

Set Up Webhook in GitHub to Trigger Jenkins Build
In GitHub, go to the Settings of your ansible-config-mgt repository.
Click on Webhooks > Add webhook.
In the Payload URL field, enter your Jenkins URL followed by /github-webhook/, for example:
plaintext
Copy code
http://your_instance_public_ip:8080/github-webhook/
Set Content type to application/json.
Under Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?, select Just the push event.
Click Add webhook to save.

(screenshot)

now go back tojenkins and click configure. scroll down to post-build actions

Configure Jenkins to Archive Build Artifacts
In the Post-build Actions section of your Jenkins job, select Archive the artifacts.
In the Files to archive field, type **/* to archive all files.
Click Save to finish configuring your Jenkins job.

(screenshot)

Test the Setup
Open your ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository, and edit the README.md file. Make a minor change, such as adding a line.
Commit the changes directly to the master branch.

(screenshot)

In Jenkins, you should see that a build is triggered automatically after the commit.

(screenshot)

Once the build completes, verify that the build artifacts are archived in the following Jenkins directory:
bash
Copy code
ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/
Replace <build_number> with the specific build number.

(screenshot)

lone Repository to Jenkins-Ansible EC2 Instance
Back in your EC2 instance terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Clone your ansible-config-mgt repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
Replace <repository-link> with the URL of your GitHub repository

(screenshot)

Prepare Your Development Environment with Visual Studio Code
Download Visual Studio Code from here and install it on your local machine.
After installing, open Visual Studio Code, and configure Git integration:
In Visual Studio Code, go to View > Terminal to open the terminal.
Navigate to the directory where you want to keep the repository on your local machine, and clone it:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
After cloning, open the folder in Visual Studio Code and start editing your files directly in VS Code.

(screenshot)

Navigate to your GitHub Repository (ansible-config-mgt):

Open your repository on GitHub.
Click on Branches (found next to the “Code” tab).
Create a New Branch:

Checkout the New Branch Locally:

Click New Branch.
Name the branch descriptively, like feature/setup-inventory-playbooks.
Click Create branch to save it.

(screenshot)

click on new terminal on your vscode it will already be inside the directory
now run 
git pull origin main
(screenshot)

heck out the new branch locally:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature/setup-inventory-playbooks
This creates and switches to the new branch on your local machine.
(screenshot)

Within your repository folder, create the following directories:
bash
Copy code
mkdir playbooks
mkdir inventory

(screenshot)

Create the common.yml Playbook:

Navigate to the playbooks folder:
bash
Copy code
cd playbooks
Create an empty playbook file called common.yml:
bash
Copy code
touch common.yml or instead of this just create new file under playbooks in vscode and name it common.yml

(screenshot)
This file will eventually hold tasks that will be run on the hosts.

now inside your VSCODE, create 4 new files namely dev, staging, uat, and prod
(screenshot)

Set Up Ansible Inventory (Defining Hosts)
Edit the Development Inventory File (dev):
Open the dev file in your vs code
Add the following inventory structure (replace the placeholder IPs with your actual private IP addresses):
ini
Copy code
[nfs]
<NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user

[webservers]
<Web-Server1-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user
<Web-Server2-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user

[db]
<Database-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user 

[lb]
<Load-Balancer-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu

(screenshot)
then save the file

Set Up SSH Agent and Import Private Key
Ansible uses SSH to connect to the servers defined in the inventory. To allow Jenkins-Ansible to connect to these servers, you’ll need to load your private key into an SSH agent.

Start the SSH Agent:

Run this command to start the SSH agent:
bash
Copy code
eval `ssh-agent -s`

(screenshot)

search for your private key following the below

Navigate to the .ssh Directory

Run the following command to go to the .ssh directory:
bash
Copy code
cd ~/.ssh
List Files in the .ssh Directory

Once in the .ssh directory, list the files to see if your private key is there:
bash
Copy code
ls
Common names for private keys are id_rsa, id_dsa, or sometimes custom names. Private keys don’t have a file extension, while public keys will end with .pub (e.g., id_rsa.pub is the public key).
Identify Your Private Key File

Look for a file without an extension (like id_rsa).

 Install and Configure Ansible on EC2 Instance
Update the Name tag on your Jenkins EC2 Instance to Jenkins-Ansible. We will use this server to run playbooks.
In your GitHub account create a new repository and name it ansible-config-mgt.
Install Ansible (see: install Ansible with pip)
sudo apt update

sudo apt install ansible
Check your Ansible version by running ansible --version


Configure Jenkins build job to archive your repository content every time you change it - this will solidify your Jenkins configuration skills acquired in Project 9.
Create a new Freestyle project ansible in Jenkins and point it to your 'ansible-config-mgt' repository.
Configure a webhook in GitHub and set the webhook to trigger ansible build.
Configure a Post-build job to save all (**) files, like you did it in Project 9.
Test your setup by making some change in README.md file in master branch and make sure that builds starts automatically and Jenkins saves the files (build artifacts) in following folder
ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/
Note: Trigger Jenkins project execution only for main (or master) branch.

Now your setup will look like this:


Tip: Every time you stop/start your Jenkins-Ansible server - you have to reconfigure GitHub webhook to a new IP address, in order to avoid it, it makes sense to allocate an Elastic IP to your Jenkins-Ansible server (you have done it before to your LB server in Project 10). Note that Elastic IP is free only when it is being allocated to an EC2 Instance, so do not forget to release Elastic IP once you terminate your EC2 Instance.

Step 2 - Prepare your development environment using Visual Studio Code
First part of 'DevOps' is 'Dev', which means you will require to write some codes and you shall have proper tools that will make your coding and debugging comfortable - you need an Integrated development environment (IDE) or Source-code Editor. There is a plethora of different IDEs and source-code Editors for different languages with their own advantages and drawbacks, you can choose whichever you are comfortable with, but we recommend one free and universal editor that will fully satisfy your needs - Visual Studio Code (VSC), you can get it here.
After you have successfully installed VSC, configure it to connect to your newly created GitHub repository.
Clone down your ansible-config-mgt repo to your Jenkins-Ansible instance
git clone <ansible-config-mgt repo link>

Let's dive into each step with clear, beginner-friendly instructions to help you achieve this phase of your project. The primary goal here is to set up and configure Ansible on an EC2 instance, set up a Jenkins job to archive the repository, and enable automation through GitHub webhooks.

1. Install and Configure Ansible on EC2 Instance
Step 1: Connect to your EC2 Instance
Go to your AWS console, select EC2, and locate your instance for Jenkins-Ansible.
Copy the Public IP of your instance and use it to SSH into your instance:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i path_to_your_key.pem ubuntu@your_instance_public_ip
Once connected, update your instance:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
Step 2: Install Ansible
Install Ansible directly on the instance:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install ansible -y
Confirm the installation by checking the version:
bash
Copy code
ansible --version
This should display Ansible’s version information, verifying that it’s installed correctly.
Step 3: Update the Instance Name Tag to "Jenkins-Ansible"
Navigate back to your AWS Console > EC2 > Instances.
Select your Jenkins EC2 instance, go to the Tags tab, click Edit, and update the Name tag to Jenkins-Ansible.
2. Create GitHub Repository for Ansible Configurations
Go to GitHub and log into your account.
Create a new repository named ansible-config-mgt.
Initialize the repository with a README file to make it easier to clone and work with later.
3. Configure Jenkins for Archiving Repository Content
Step 1: Create a New Freestyle Project in Jenkins
Open Jenkins (http://your_instance_public_ip:8080).
Select New Item on the Jenkins dashboard.
Name your project ansible, select Freestyle project, and click OK.
In the Source Code Management section, select Git.
In the Repository URL field, paste the URL of your ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository.
Step 2: Set Up Webhook in GitHub to Trigger Jenkins Build
In GitHub, go to the Settings of your ansible-config-mgt repository.
Click on Webhooks > Add webhook.
In the Payload URL field, enter your Jenkins URL followed by /github-webhook/, for example:
plaintext
Copy code
http://your_instance_public_ip:8080/github-webhook/
Set Content type to application/json.
Under Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?, select Just the push event.
Click Add webhook to save.
Note: Since your instance’s IP may change, consider using an Elastic IP to maintain a consistent IP address.

Step 3: Configure Jenkins to Archive Build Artifacts
In the Post-build Actions section of your Jenkins job, select Archive the artifacts.
In the Files to archive field, type **/* to archive all files.
Click Save to finish configuring your Jenkins job.
4. Test the Setup
Open your ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository, and edit the README.md file. Make a minor change, such as adding a line.
Commit the changes directly to the master branch.
In Jenkins, you should see that a build is triggered automatically after the commit.
Once the build completes, verify that the build artifacts are archived in the following Jenkins directory:
bash
Copy code
ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/
Replace <build_number> with the specific build number.
5. Clone Repository to Jenkins-Ansible EC2 Instance
Back in your EC2 instance terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Clone your ansible-config-mgt repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
Replace <repository-link> with the URL of your GitHub repository (you can find it on your GitHub repo page under the Code button).
6. Prepare Your Development Environment with Visual Studio Code
Download Visual Studio Code from here and install it on your local machine.
After installing, open Visual Studio Code, and configure Git integration:
In Visual Studio Code, go to View > Terminal to open the terminal.
Navigate to the directory where you want to keep the repository on your local machine, and clone it:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>
After cloning, open the folder in Visual Studio Code and start editing your files directly in VS Code.
Final Tip:
Using an Elastic IP will save you the trouble of reconfiguring the GitHub webhook each time you restart your instance. Allocate the Elastic IP in the AWS console and attach it to your EC2 instance, ensuring your Jenkins IP address remains constant. Remember to release it if you terminate the instance to avoid unnecessary charges.

Following these steps should set up your Ansible and Jenkins integration while allowing easy code management via GitHub and Visual Studio Code.

Begin Ansible Development
In your ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository, create a new branch that will be used for development of a new feature.
Tip: Give your branches descriptive and comprehensive names, for example, if you use Jira or Trello as a project management tool - include ticket number (e.g. PRJ-145) in the name of your branch and add a topic and a brief description what this branch is about - a bugfix, hotfix, feature, release (e.g. feature/prj-145-lvm)

Checkout the newly created feature branch to your local machine and start building your code and directory structure
Create a directory and name it playbooks - it will be used to store all your playbook files.
Create a directory and name it inventory - it will be used to keep your hosts organised.
Within the playbooks folder, create your first playbook, and name it common.yml
Within the inventory folder, create an inventory file () for each environment (Development, Staging Testing and Production) dev, staging, uat, and prod respectively. These inventory files use .ini languages style to configure Ansible hosts.
Step 4 - Set up an Ansible Inventory
An Ansible inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. Since our intention is to execute Linux commands on remote hosts, and ensure that it is the intended configuration on a particular server that occurs. It is important to have a way to organize our hosts in such an Inventory.

Save the below inventory structure in the inventory/dev file to start configuring your development servers. Ensure to replace the IP addresses according to your own setup.

Note: Ansible uses TCP port 22 by default, which means it needs to ssh into target servers from Jenkins-Ansible host - for this you can implement the concept of ssh-agent. Now you need to import your key into ssh-agent:

To learn how to setup SSH agent and connect VS Code to your Jenkins-Ansible instance, please see this video:

For Windows users - ssh-agent on windows
For Linux users - ssh-agent on linux
eval ssh-agent -s
ssh-add <path-to-private-key>
Confirm the key has been added with the command below, you should see the name of your key

ssh-add -l 
Now, ssh into your Jenkins-Ansible server using ssh-agent

ssh -A ubuntu@public-ip
To learn how to setup SSH agent and connect VS Code to your Jenkins-Ansible instance, please see this video: Windows Linux

Also notice, that your Load Balancer user is ubuntu and user for RHEL-based servers is ec2-user.

Update your inventory/dev.yml file with this snippet of code:

[nfs]
<NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user

[nfs]
<NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user

[webservers]
<Web-Server1-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user
<Web-Server2-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user

[db]
<Database-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user 

[lb]
<Load-Balancer-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu



I am done with the first phase through your guidiance. now the above is the next phase. please create a step by step beginner friendly way to achieve the next phase which is the task above.i am trying to avoid mistakes. please make it self explanatory especially navigating through each technology used

Great job completing the first phase! Now, let's proceed with the next steps to start developing with Ansible. The main goal here is to set up your development branch in GitHub, organize the Ansible project structure, configure your inventory files, and set up SSH connections to your servers.

1. Create a Development Branch in GitHub
Navigate to your GitHub Repository (ansible-config-mgt):

Open your repository on GitHub.
Click on Branches (found next to the “Code” tab).
Create a New Branch:

Click New Branch.
Name the branch descriptively, like feature/setup-inventory-playbooks.
Click Create branch to save it.
Checkout the New Branch Locally:

In your terminal, navigate to your local repository:
bash
Copy code
cd ansible-config-mgt
Pull the latest updates from GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
Check out the new branch locally:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature/setup-inventory-playbooks
This creates and switches to the new branch on your local machine.
2. Set Up Project Directory Structure
Create Directories for Ansible Playbooks and Inventory Files:

Within your repository folder, create the following directories:
bash
Copy code
mkdir playbooks
mkdir inventory
These will store playbooks and inventory files to organize your configurations.
Create the common.yml Playbook:

Navigate to the playbooks folder:
bash
Copy code
cd playbooks
Create an empty playbook file called common.yml:
bash
Copy code
touch common.yml
This file will eventually hold tasks that will be run on the hosts.
Create Inventory Files for Different Environments:

Go back to the root directory of your repository:
bash
Copy code
cd ..
In the inventory directory, create files for each environment:
bash
Copy code
cd inventory
touch dev staging uat prod
You should now see four files in your inventory folder: dev, staging, uat, and prod.
3. Set Up Ansible Inventory (Defining Hosts)
Edit the Development Inventory File (dev):
Open the dev file in a text editor like nano:
bash
Copy code
nano dev
Add the following inventory structure (replace the placeholder IPs with your actual private IP addresses):
ini
Copy code
[nfs]
<NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user

[webservers]
<Web-Server1-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user
<Web-Server2-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user

[db]
<Database-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user 

[lb]
<Load-Balancer-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu
Save and exit the file by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y to confirm changes, and Enter.
Explanation: This file defines different groups (like nfs, webservers, db, and lb) and their respective hosts (servers). Each server is identified by its private IP and associated with a specific SSH user (e.g., ec2-user or ubuntu) that Ansible will use to connect.

4. Set Up SSH Agent and Import Private Key
Ansible uses SSH to connect to the servers defined in the inventory. To allow Jenkins-Ansible to connect to these servers, you’ll need to load your private key into an SSH agent.

Start the SSH Agent:

Run this command to start the SSH agent:
bash
Copy code
eval `ssh-agent -s`
Add the Private Key to SSH Agent:

Add your private key to the agent (replace <path-to-private-key> with the actual path to your key file):
bash
Copy code
ssh-add <path-to-private-key>
Confirm the key is added:
bash
Copy code
ssh-add -l
You should see the key’s fingerprint, confirming it’s been added.
Test SSH Connection Using SSH Agent:

Connect to one of your target servers to verify that the SSH agent is working correctly. Run the following command (replace <server-IP> with a private IP from your inventory):
bash
Copy code
ssh -A ec2-user@<server-IP>
If the connection is successful without needing a password, the SSH agent is set up correctly. Type exit to disconnect from the server.
5. Push Changes to GitHub
After setting up your directory structure, playbook, and inventory files, commit and push these changes to GitHub.

Add Files to Git:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit Your Changes:

Write a meaningful commit message:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Set up Ansible directory structure and development inventory"
Push the Changes to GitHub:

Push to your feature branch:
bash
Copy code
git push origin feature/setup-inventory-playbooks
6. Connect VS Code to Your Jenkins-Ansible EC2 Instance
Using Visual Studio Code Remote SSH Extension allows you to connect and edit files directly on your Jenkins-Ansible server.

Open Visual Studio Code and install the Remote - SSH extension from the Extensions marketplace.
In VS Code, press F1, type "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host," and press Enter.
Add a new SSH connection with:
plaintext
Copy code
ssh ubuntu@<your-public-ip>
(Replace <your-public-ip> with the public IP of your Jenkins-Ansible instance).
Once connected, you can edit files directly on the server as needed.

Final Verification
Verify that all the setup steps are complete and that files are correctly organized.
Check that your SSH connection works smoothly between Jenkins-Ansible and the target servers.
You’re now ready to start developing your Ansible playbooks and configurations! Let me know if you need more guidance on specific configurations or tasks.

It looks like there was a mix-up with using ssh-add. Instead of adding the agent’s PID (the process ID) to ssh-add, you need to add the path to your private SSH key file. Let's go over the steps more carefully to ensure everything works smoothly.

1. Start the SSH Agent
Run the following command to start the SSH agent. This should only be done once per session:
bash
Copy code
eval `ssh-agent -s`
This command will start the SSH agent and output a PID (process ID), which you don’t need to use in the next step.
2. Add Your Private Key to the SSH Agent
Now, add your actual private SSH key file to the agent, You need to specify the full path to your private key file, typically something like ~/.ssh/id_rsa. For example:
bash
Copy code
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Note: If your key has a different name or is located in a different directory, use that path instead.
3. Verify the Key is Added
To confirm that your key was added successfully, use:
bash
Copy code
ssh-add -l
If successful, you should see the key's fingerprint, confirming that it’s ready for use.
